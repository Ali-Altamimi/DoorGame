  <h3 align="center">The Three Doors Game</h3>

  <p align="center">
  I have been always spectic of the saying that changing the door is better than keeping it. As a result, I wrote this simple code to answer the question is changing the door is better than keeping the current selected one?

The result for large 100,000 tests is 63.37% which indicate that changing the doors is better than keeping the first selected door.
